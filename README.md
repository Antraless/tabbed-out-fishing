This script allows you to tab out while AFK fishing. You do not need to change your keybinds, all instructions are listed below. Works on any planet and perfect catches every time!

# How to install (do this first!)
1. Download the .exe [here](https://github.com/Antraless/tabbed-out-fishing/raw/main/tabbed-out-fishing.exe) or .ahk [here](https://antraless.github.io/tabbed-out-fishing/tabbed-out-fishing.ahk) (anti-virus gets mad at the .exe - disable your anti-virus or use the .ahk)
   * To run the .ahk file you will need to install [AHK 1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)
2. Run `tabbed-out-fishing.exe` or `tabbed-out-fishing.ahk` (whichever you downloaded) 
   * Three extra files will be created: `ViGEmWrapper.dll`, `fishinglog.txt` and `ViGEmBus_1.21.442_x64_x86_arm64.exe`
3. Run `ViGEmBus_1.21.442_x64_x86_arm64.exe` to install ViGEmBus

You have now installed the script!
# How to use (do this second!)
1. Ensure that your in-game brightness is 7
   * You may have to turn off "HDR", "Chromatic Aberration" and "Wind Impulse" if your catches are inconsistent
2. Run `tabbed-out-fishing.exe` or `tabbed-out-fishing.ahk`
3. Open Destiny 2, go to a fishing pond and press F4 to start fishing when you see the fishing prompt
   * You may have to run the script as Administrator if the keybinds do not work

The script should then begin fishing!
# Notes
- The weapon switching is to ensure that the game is in controller mode rather than keyboard and mouse mode
- If you have a real controller plugged in, you may have to unplug it
- The jiggle up and down is an anti-AFK measure
- The "x" that appears on screen must be visible
- If you move the Destiny 2 window, you will need to restart (F3) the script
- I recommened that you put your Destiny 2 into windowed mode and place it somewhere out of the way so you can fish and use your pc as normal(ish)
   * If you do not have a second monitor, you can use your phone with an app like spacedesk
- Thanks to _kreken, leopoldprime, .spawnova, Ahdem and savageplayz for helping me out during testing!
## Script Keybinds: 
- F8 to center the window (for if D2 gets stuck somewhere in windowed mode)
- F4 to start fishing
- F3 to pause the script (to do public events, or whatever)
- F2 to close the script
