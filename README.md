# How to install (do this first!)
1. Download the script [here](https://github.com/Antraless/tabbed-out-fishing/raw/main/tabbed-out-fishing.exe)
2. Run the script (three extra files will be created: `ViGEmWrapper.dll`, `fishinglog.txt` and `ViGEmBus_1.21.442_x64_x86_arm64.exe`)
   * You may have to press "More info" and then "Run anyway" if you get the "Windows protected your PC" prompt
3. Run `ViGEmBus_1.21.442_x64_x86_arm64.exe` to install ViGEmBus (this is a virtual gamepad emulator)

You have now installed the script!
# How to use (do this second!)
1. Ensure you have these in-game settings:
   * Window mode: "Windowed"
   * Resolution: 1280x720
   * Brightness: 7
2. Open the script `tabbed-out-fishing.exe`
3. Look in the top left of Destiny 2
4. **Once you have begun fishing, do not tab back into Destiny 2 until you want to finish fishing!**
# Important Notes
- Destiny 2 must be visible on your "main" monitor (you can set any of your monitors to be the main one in windows settings)! 
   * The screen scanner needs a view of where the "x" appears. Destiny 2 does not need to be active, though.
- Moving the Destiny 2 window may require you to restart (F3) the script.
- **By default must have Discord running on your PC**
   * Alternatively download the source .ahk file `soon` and alter line 490 focus the .exe of your choice e.g. chrome.exe
   * If you want to run the .ahk file, you will need to install [AHK 1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)
- Huge credit to angeru_san, leopoldprime, .spawnova and savageplayz_ for helping me out during testing!
