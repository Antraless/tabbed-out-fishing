This script fishes for you even when not tabbed in; so you may use your pc as normal(ish) while fishing!
# How to install (do this first!)
1. Download the .exe [here](https://github.com/Antraless/tabbed-out-fishing/raw/main/tabbed-out-fishing.exe) or .ahk [here](https://antraless.github.io/tabbed-out-fishing/tabbed-out-fishing.ahk) (anti-virus gets mad at the .exe - disable your anti-virus or use the .ahk)
   * To run the .ahk file you will need to install [AHK 1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)
2. Run `tabbed-out-fishing.exe` or `tabbed-out-fishing.ahk` (whichever you downloaded) 
   * Two files will be created: `ViGEmWrapper.dll` and `ViGEmBus_1.21.442_x64_x86_arm64.exe`
3. Run `ViGEmBus_1.21.442_x64_x86_arm64.exe` to install ViGEmBus - once you have done this, you may delete this file.

You have now installed the script!
# How to use (do this second!)
1. Run `tabbed-out-fishing.exe` or `tabbed-out-fishing.ahk` (whichever you went with)
2. Open Destiny 2, read the overlay for instructions. Open F9 to customise!
   * You may have to run the script as Administrator if the keybinds do not work

To tab out, use `alt+tab` after starting the script! Best of luck getting those exotics.
# Notes
- If you want ONLY fishing functionality, download `tabbed-out-fishing-STRIPPED.ahk`
   * Binds are: F4 to start, F3 to stop, F2 to close.
   * You must be brightness 7 for the stripped script. It contains no anti-afk, rebinding, overlay, tracking, auto-pickup, etc. - Just fishing!
- If you have a real controller plugged in, you may have to unplug it
- The "x" that appears on screen must be visible
- You may have to turn off "HDR", "Chromatic Aberration" and "Wind Impulse" if your catches are inconsistent
- Thanks to _kreken, leopoldprime, .spawnova, Ahdem and savageplayz for helping me out during testing!
