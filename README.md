This script fishes for you even when not tabbed in; so you may use your pc as normal(ish) while fishing!
# How to install (do this first!)
1. Download the script [here](https://antraless.github.io/tabbed-out-fishing/tabbed-out-fishing.ahk)
2. Run the script (requires AHK 1.1: https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)
3. Follow the instructions that pop up once you run the script! *There may be no instructions if you have used another one of my scripts previously*
4. Go to a fishing pond, review your settings in the Info/Options menu (F9 by default)
5. Start the script once you see the fishing interact dialogue!
To tab out, use `alt+tab` after starting the script! Best of luck getting those exotics.
# Notes
- If you want ONLY fishing functionality, download `tabbed-out-fishing-STRIPPED.ahk`
   * Binds are: F4 to start, F3 to stop, F2 to close.
   * You must be brightness 7 for the stripped script. It contains no anti-afk, rebinding, overlay, tracking, auto-pickup, etc. - Just fishing!
- If you have a real controller plugged in, you may have to unplug it
- The "x" that appears on screen must be visible
- You may have to turn off "HDR", "Chromatic Aberration" and "Wind Impulse" if your catches are inconsistent
- Thanks to _kreken, leopoldprime, .spawnova, Ahdem and savageplayz for helping me out during testing!
