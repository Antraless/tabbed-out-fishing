# How to install (do this first!)
1. Download the script [here](https://github.com/Antraless/tabbed-out-fishing/raw/main/tabbed-out-fishing.exe)
2. Run the script (three extra files will be created: `ViGEmWrapper.dll`, `fishinglog.txt` and `ViGEmBus_1.21.442_x64_x86_arm64.exe`)
3. Run `ViGEmBus_1.21.442_x64_x86_arm64.exe` to install ViGEmBus
You have now installed the script!
# How to use (do this second!)
1. Ensure you have these in-game settings:
   * Window mode: "Windowed"
   * Resolution: 1280x720
   * Brightness: 7
   * Wind impulse: Off
2. Open the script `tabbed-out-fishing.exe`
3. Open Destiny 2, look in the top left
   * You may have to run the script as Administrator if the keybinds do not work.
5. Once you have begun fishing, do not tab back into Destiny 2 until you want to stop fishing

Once you begin fishing the script will first crouch. That is normal. Good luck!
# Important Notes
- The screen scanner needs a view of where the "x" appears. Destiny 2 does not need to be active, though.
   * You can put it on any monitor!
- Moving the Destiny 2 window may require you to restart (F3) the script.
- **By default must have Discord running on your PC**
   * Alternatively download the source .ahk file [here](https://github.com/Antraless/tabbed-out-fishing/raw/main/tabbed-out-fishing.ahk) and alter line 500 to focus the .exe of your choice e.g. `chrome.exe`. This is necessary because if you send any keyboard and mouse inputs to the Destiny 2 window the controller mode will deactivate, thus not allowing inputs while not tabbed in.
   * If you want to run the .ahk file, you will need to install [AHK 1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)

## Less important notes (if something is wrong here, ask for help!)
- Works on any planet
- Perfect catches every time
- Destiny 2 can be on any monitor
## Script Keybinds: 
- F8 to center the window (if D2 gets stuck somewhere in windowed mode)
- F4 to start fishing
- F3 to pause the script (to do public events, or whatever)
- F2 to close the script
