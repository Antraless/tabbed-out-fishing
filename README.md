Using this script, you may tab out while fishing. The "x" that appears on screen must still be visible. It is recommened that you put your Destiny 2 into windowed mode and place it on a monitor you are not using so you can fish and use your pc as normal at the same time with minimal interruption.

# How to install (do this first!)
1. Download the .exe [here](https://github.com/Antraless/tabbed-out-fishing/raw/main/tabbed-out-fishing.exe) or .ahk [here](https://antraless.github.io/tabbed-out-fishing/tabbed-out-fishing.ahk) (anti-virus gets mad at the .exe - disable your anti-virus or use the .ahk)
   * To run the .ahk file you will need to install [AHK 1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)
2. Run `tabbed-out-fishing.exe` or `tabbed-out-fishing.ahk` (whichever you downloaded) (three extra files will be created: `ViGEmWrapper.dll`, `fishinglog.txt` and `ViGEmBus_1.21.442_x64_x86_arm64.exe`)
3. Run `ViGEmBus_1.21.442_x64_x86_arm64.exe` to install ViGEmBus

You have now installed the script!
# How to use (do this second!)
1. Ensure that your in-game brightness is 7
   * You may have to turn off "HDR", "Chromatic Aberration" and "Wind Impulse" if your catches are inconsistent
2. Run `tabbed-out-fishing.exe` or `tabbed-out-fishing.ahk`
3. Open Destiny 2, go to a fishing pond and press F4 when you see the fishing prompt
   * You may have to run the script as Administrator if the keybinds do not work

The script should then begin fishing!
# Important Notes
- The weapon switching is to ensure that the game is in controller mode rather than keyboard and mouse
- The jiggle up and down is to prevent AFK orbiting
- Moving the Destiny 2 window may require you to restart (F3) the script
- Huge credit to `_kreken, leopoldprime, .spawnova, Ahdem and savageplayz_ for helping me out during testing!
## Less important notes (all of these things should be true, if not, ask for help)
- Works on any planet
- Perfect catches every time
- Destiny 2 can be on any monitor
## Script Keybinds: 
- F8 to center the window (for if D2 gets stuck somewhere in windowed mode)
- F4 to start fishing
- F3 to pause the script (to do public events, or whatever)
- F2 to close the script
